I have over 25 years’ experience in IT, worked as lead developer on large projects, and have designed and implemented many systems from the ground up.

\medskip

I hold a PhD in computer science from National Taiwan University and published my work in the field’s top conference.

\medskip

Recently I'm mostly doing commercial work, but I’m always keeping an eye on new research developments.

\medskip

I have strong analytical skills and experience with a wide variety of technologies. A recurring theme in my career has been performance analysis and tuning, from tiny embedded virtual machines, to large scale databases and complex enterprise infrastructures. As hobby projects, I recently started studying category theory and Haskell, and am getting my feet wet in machine learning.

\medskip

I also enjoy thinking about the softer side of software development. Are we solving the right problems? Which new technologies make us more productive, and which just swamp us with unnecessary choices? Is technology changing ever faster, or is it slowing down? And what does that mean for how we develop software?

\cvevent{Lead / Senior Software Developer}{DSW Health Insurance}{Apr 2005 -- Ongoing}{Schiedam, The Netherlands}

Apr 2005 -- Jan 2007: Software developer responsible for maintaining the pharmaceutical claims processing software.

\medskip

Feb 2007 -- Nov 2009: Oversaw the development of the new claims processing system as the lead developer.

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
	\item Delivered on time, it has been running reliably for 13 years and proven to be very maintainable, despite being the company's most complex system.
	\item It produced several spin-off products that became a company-wide standard for other teams, leading to improved efficiency and standardization.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

Since 2011: After moving to Taiwan to study Chinese and pursue a PhD, I was granted the opportunity to come back to work as a senior developer for several months every year. This privilege was not typically offered to other employees, and I am grateful for this flexibility.


\medskip

\begin{itemize}
	\item Worked on and built many different systems, often with a focus on performance tuning.
	\item Initiated two high-impact projects:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] The development of a system for company-wide monitoring of service calls. This provided valuable and previously unavailable real-time insight in the behavior and performance of their systems.
		\item[-] Identified a problem with the growing complexity of the deployment system. On my suggestion this was changed to an XML-based ‘convention over configuration' solution. This improved maintainability and reduced the burden for developers, who no longer have to write deployments scripts.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Rebuilt a database conversion that an external party had been working on unsuccessfully for months. My implementation took 1 week to build and ran in minutes rather than hours. This allowed us to convert our data in an acceptable time frame and the project to go live.
\end{itemize}

\cvsection[]{Achievements}
To give an impression of my work, below is a more detailed description of some past projects I’m particularly pleased with.

\bigskip

\cvsubsection{CapeVM}

During my PhD I developed a Java Virtual Machine for resource-constrained embedded CPUs. These typically have only a few KB of RAM, and in the order of tens of KBs of flash program memory. Their extremely low power consumption allows them to run for months or years on a single charge, if programmed correctly.

\medskip\medskip

Many proof-of-concept VMs have been developed for these devices, but, as interpreters, they are all one to two orders of magnitude slower than native code. This significantly increases energy consumption and thus negates the main advantage of these CPUs.

\medskip\medskip

My research showed that, even with so little resources, it is possible to translate Java bytecode to native code at load time, on the device. With a number of carefully designed optimizations, this leads to performance several times faster than existing VMs, and within half that of optimized native C.

\medskip\medskip

Besides platform independence, the resulting VM can also provide a safe execution environment and protect the device from buggy or malicious code, at a performance cost that is on-par with or lower than existing native code solutions.

\medskip\medskip

The paper describing the final result was accepted to SenSys 2018, the top conference in the field with a 16\% acceptance rate.

\bigskip\bigskip

\cvsubsection{Health insurance claims processing}
After working for DSW Health Insurance for almost two years, I was made lead engineer for their new claims processing system, which at the time was done by a number of different systems. This project was part of the plan to migrate all legacy systems to .Net.

\medskip\medskip

I led a team of 5 engineers to implement this system, designing many of the core parts of the system myself. The first version, initially processing claims for a single, but complex, type of health care was delivered in just over 2,5 years.

\medskip\medskip

It has since been extended to replace all other claims processing systems. Over the past 13 years it has proven to be very maintainable, requiring no major refactoring, despite being the company’s largest and functionally most complex systems.

\medskip\medskip

When we started this project, the company had only recently started using .Net and much of the infrastructure needed to build a system like this was missing. As a result, we produced several spin-off projects that were subsequently adopted as standards by the rest of the company, many of which are still in use today:

\medskip\medskip

\begin{itemize}
	\item\small \textbf{Background processing engine}: To automatically process incoming claims and several related processes, we developed a uniform way to define these processes, handle incoming tasks, set priorities, configure worker threads, handle errors, etc.
	
	This engine has since been generalized and made the standard to implement background processing for all other projects within the company.
	\item\small \textbf{Standard set of code generation templates}: These generate the database and data access layer, which enforced a level of consistency across projects. It also made it easy to generate other features from the entity definitions, such as views to hide privacy sensitive information when developers access production data, or an in-memory database which greatly sped-up unit testing.
	\item\small \textbf{Simple workflow system}: What pleased me about this spin-off in particular, is how the company was about to start down a traditional waterfall process asking users for the requirements for the new workflow system. I believed this would lead to an unnecessarily complex solution, while a simple to-do list would be sufficient for us.
	
	This intuition proved to be correct, and we implemented a simple approach with just two tables: Task and TaskType, which has since been used by all subsequent .Net projects with only minor extensions.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip\bigskip

\cvsubsection{Efficient code distribution in wireless sensor networks}
While doing my research on wireless sensor networks, reprogramming them by connecting a cable to each device quickly became tedious, so I developed a way to reprogram our nodes remotely.

\medskip\medskip

I developed a simple diff language to update the code using the binary image already present on the device. This required only a fraction of the bandwidth that would be needed to transmit a complete new image.

\medskip\medskip

Similar to my work on CapeVM, a few binary optimizations were important. The key realization was that, after a small code change, most of the resulting binary code is identical, except for a shift in addresses. By including a short list of address ranges and offsets, the receiving node could patch all memory accesses automatically, significantly reducing the size of the patch script.

\medskip\medskip

To date this is my most cited research paper.

\bigskip\bigskip

\newpage

\cvsubsection{Automated deploys}{}{}{}
DSW Health Insurance already had an automated deployment system running for a number of years which deployed 200+ modules to a range of target environments. In this system each module provided PowerShell scripts to deploy their code.

\medskip\medskip

It quickly became clear to me that this approach would become unmaintainable over time as the deploy scripts, often copy-pasted from one project to another, were starting to diverge and cause conflicts.

\medskip\medskip

Therefore, I proposed switching to an approach where teams specify what to deploy in a centrally stored XML file, and the deployment system deploys this following fixed conventions that can only be overridden where necessary.

\medskip\medskip

The key insight was that since the deployment system is completely under our own control, it can be very limited in the functionality it offers. If needed, new functionality can be easily added, but ideally there should only be a single way to deploy similar artifacts.

\medskip\medskip

This approach had several advantages:

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
\item\small It relieved teams from having to write the code to deploy their application.
\item\small It led to greater consistency in how systems are deployed.
\item\small Deployed items are named consistently, making them easier to find and identify.
\item\small The central repository of xmls provides a global view of what is being deployed.
\item\small By modifying the scripts, the way things are deployed can be changed globally, for all modules at the same time. For instance, this has been used to switch to encrypted database connections without requiring any action from development teams.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip\bigskip

\cvsubsection{Service call tracing}{}{}{}
While working on designing an automated system to do integration testing of the company’s complicate application landscape, it became clear there was no insight into what service calls were being made between systems. This meant we did not know what scenarios should be tested to achieve good test coverage.

\medskip\medskip

At the time the company was almost exclusively using Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). To get an objective measurement of which systems were communicating, I developed a tracing tool that settles into the WCF stack and log all calls sent to, or originating from a server. By deploying this on both the production and testing environment and comparing the data, we were able to determine the test coverage of our integration tests.

\medskip\medskip

Besides being useful to determine test coverage, the previously unavailable insight obtained from this tracing soon proved extremely valuable to monitor performance and analyze production issues.

\medskip\medskip

Later, correlation ids were added to outgoing requests, which allows us to follow a flow over multiple systems, and we added tracing of several other events such web API calls, service bus messages, and the processing engine described earlier. 

\medskip\medskip

Although more limited in scope, it often provided insights that could not have been obtained from far more expensive solutions like Dynatrace.
