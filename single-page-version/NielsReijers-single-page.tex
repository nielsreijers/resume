\cvexperience{Senior Software Engineer}{Proton Mail}{Aug 2024 -- Ongoing}{Taipei, Taiwan}


Traffic Analysis \& DDoS Protection:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Maintained and improved ClickHouse-based traffic analysis pipelines.
	\item Increased DDoS mitigation capacity roughly 5-fold by isolating it from heavy analytics.
	
	\item Improved anomaly detection for early issue detection through automated root-cause analysis.
\end{itemize}
AI Agentic Framework: Main contributor on an AutoGen-based infrastructure for task automation, including LLM interfaces, agent and prompt design.

\medskip\cvexperience{Staff Software Engineer}{DSW Health Insurance (contract)}{Jun 2011 -- Apr 2025}{Schiedam, The Netherlands}

After leaving DSW to study Chinese and pursue a PhD, I was given the opportunity to combine this with contract work, from 2016 as Staff Software Engineer. This privilege was not typically offered to other employees.

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
	\item Designed, implemented and worked on many different systems myself. Ad hoc troubleshooter or contributor on many others.
	\item Often focussed on automation, observability and performance optimization.
	\item Initiated high-impact projects, including:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] Company-wide service call observability which provided valuable and previously unavailable real-time insight into the systems' behaviour.
		\item[-] Converting the deployment system from script-based to a ‘convention over configuration' solution. This improved maintainability and stability, and reduced the burden on developers.
	\end{itemize}

Collaborated with professor Chih-Wen Hsueh at NTU on a novel block chain, and professor Yuh-Jye Lee at Sinica on a project to correct online disinformation.

\medskip\medskip\cvexperience{Doctoral Candidate}{Intel-NTU Connected Context Computing Center}{Sep 2011 -- Apr 2018}{Taipei, Taiwan}

Improved the state of the art for Java VMs for resource-constrained IoT devices:

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
	\item Improved performance to close to optimized C, thus reducing energy consumption, through on-device ahead-of-time compilation to native code.
	\item Provided a platform independent and sandboxed environment to protect devices from malicious code.
\end{itemize}
