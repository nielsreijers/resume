\cvsection[page1sidebar]{Experience}

\cvevent{Lead / Senior Software Developer}{DSW Health Insurance}{Apr 2005 -- Ongoing}{Schiedam, The Netherlands}

Oversaw the development of the new claims processing system as lead developer.

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
	\item Delivered on time, running reliably for 13 years and proven to be very maintainable, despite being the company's most complex system.
	\item Produced several spin-off products that became a company-wide standard for other teams, leading to improved efficiency and standardization.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

After moving to Taiwan in 2009 to study Chinese and pursue a PhD, I was granted the opportunity to come back to work as a senior developer for several months every year. This privilege was not typically offered to other employees, and I am grateful for this flexibility.

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
	\item Worked on and built many different systems, often with a focus on performance tuning.
	\item Initiated two high-impact projects:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] The development of a system for company-wide monitoring of service calls. This provided valuable and previously unavailable real-time insight in the behavior and performance of their systems.
		\item[-] Identified a problem with the growing complexity of the deployment system. On my suggestion this was changed to an XML-based ‘convention over configuration' solution. This improved maintainability and reduced the burden for developers, who no longer have to write deployments scripts.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Rebuilt a database conversion that an external party had been working on unsuccessfully for months. My implementation took 1 week to build and ran in minutes rather than hours. This allowed us to convert our data in an acceptable time frame and the project to go live.
\end{itemize}

\medskip\medskip\cvevent{Doctoral Candidate}{Intel-NTU Connected Context Computing Center}{Sep 2011 -- Apr 2018}{Taipei, Taiwan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Developed a Java Virtual Machine for resource-constrained Internet-of-Things devices such as the Atmel ATMEGA128.
	\item Implemented on-device ahead-of-time compilation to native code to drastically improve performance compared to existing VMs in this class, which are one to two orders of magnitude slower than optimized C.
\end{itemize}

Improved the state of the art by:

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
	\item Improving performance to close to optimized C and thus reducing energy consumption, while maintaining platform independence.
	\item Providing a safe execution environment to protect devices from buggy or malicious code, at a cost comparable to existing native code solutions.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

The results were published in SenSys 2018, the field's top conference.
